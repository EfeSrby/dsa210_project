# My Apple Health Data Analysis


## Motivation
While trying to find a topic for my project, it occured to me that I am very involved in sports. Then I thought I might analyze my health and activity data which is mostly stored by Apple Health. Since I have my phone with me most of the time and Apple Health keeps data all the time during this proccess, I thought Apple Health would be a good choice for this project. This project's motivation is to understand that personal health trends can provide actionable insights for improving lifestyle and productivity by exploring my Apple Health data to uncover patterns, relationships, and predictions related to activity, sleep, and overall fitness.


## Data Source
- Source: Apple Health application
- Collection Method: Data will be automatically collected through my Apple devices. Data synced through Apple Health which is found in my devices.
- Data Categories: These are the type of data I am interested.

### Data Privacy
All data which I used in this project will remain local and anonymized during analysis. Raw data will not be shared. I only processed and visualized the insights and visualizations.


## Project Goals
1. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to visualize trends in health metrics.
2. Analyzing the correlations between my data categories.
